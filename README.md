This project is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features for use in model construction. Feature selection techniques are used for simplify the data models making them easier for interpretation by the research community. Reduce the time used in training. Enhance generalization by reducing over fitting of data. Feature selection techniques is applied to maximize relevance and minimize redundancy of abstracted data sets. Using the test statistics and visualize the discriminating genes for micro-array classification and Investigating the performance of these ranking methods on micro-array data sets regarding health care. The performance is evaluated in terms of classification accuracy and number of genes.
